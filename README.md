Timeweaver 
The Great Hourglass has been infected. Filling one side of it will cause a distruption in the flow of time...

Our universe is doomed... unless Zorm The Timeweaver is here for the rescue!

Play as Zorm, and navigate through the Spacetime Labyrinth to reach The Great Hourglass.
Use Zorm's gravity-mending abilities to avoid obstacles and enemies. But be warned, The Direction of gravity affects the flow of sand in The Great Hourglass!
